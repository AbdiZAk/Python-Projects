**Project Summary**

In this project I use the googlegeocode API and openweather API with pandas to create a Report of 
Seven day for a given location. The program returns a pandas dataframe that has the lows and highs for
each day of the week and the corresponding weather icon from openweather API.


**APIS USED**

**GoogleGeoCode API** - Google's geo code API is very percise and gives exact geo cornates of any location.

**OpenWeather API** - Using the Openweather API I get the seven day forecast of the location including 
  weather Icon, high and lows for each day.
